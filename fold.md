## fold base part
we need this part 30x

the paper has to be square - i used 140mm - this way you can cut two peaces out of a DIN-A4 sheet.

- Step 1
  lay the sheet in front of you
![Step 1](images/fold_base_part/P1750929.JPG)
- Step 2
    fold in half
    ![Step 2](images/fold_base_part/P1750930.JPG)
- Step 3
    unfold and rotate so that the fold is vertical
    ![Step 3](images/fold_base_part/P1750931.JPG)
- Step 4
    fold the right down corner in up to the center of the sheet
    ![Step 4](images/fold_base_part/P1750932.JPG)
- Step 5
    repeat with top left corner
    ![Step 5](images/fold_base_part/P1750933.JPG)
- Step 6
    turn paper upside-down.
    rotate so that the first fold-line goes from top left to bottom right.
    ![Step 6](images/fold_base_part/P1750934.JPG)
- Step 7
    fold top-right (the edge that already has a fold) to meet with the center line (similar to paper-planes..)
    ![Step 7](images/fold_base_part/P1750935.JPG)
- Step 8
    repeat with bottom side symmetrically
    ![Step 8](images/fold_base_part/P1750936.JPG)
- Step 9
    turn paper upside-down
    ![Step 9](images/fold_base_part/P1750938.JPG)
- Step 10
    hui - this one is a bit complex to describe.
    there are two triangles pointing with there tips at the center.
    on the top one there is a corner at the end of the long edge that meets with the top edge of the paper.
    on the bottom triangle there is a corner at the short edge that meets with the bottom edge of the paper.
    between these two points is our new folding line - fold from bottom right inwards.
    ![Step 10](images/fold_base_part/P1750940.JPG)
- Step 11
    repeat the same symmetrically..
    ![Step 11](images/fold_base_part/P1750941.JPG)
- Step 12
    turn paper upside-down
    ![Step 12](images/fold_base_part/P1750942.JPG)
- Step 13
    there is a short paper thing sticking out under the main parallelogram.
    fold this inwards.
    ![Step 13](images/fold_base_part/P1750943.JPG)
- Step 14
    repeat symmetrically
    ![Step 14](images/fold_base_part/P1750944.JPG)
- Step 15
    now fold the parallelogram into half - this results in a triangle.
    ![Step 15](images/fold_base_part/P1750945.JPG)
- Step 16
    it will open up a little bit - that is fine - this is the *in-between space* for two star-tips..
